There are two roads you can walk when you want to change something.

The first is the Road of Permission. On this road, you can only initiate change by asking for permission from the people in charge. For example, a developer can only start on a new feature after it is approved by the team lead.

The second is the Road of Initiative. Here, you skip the approval you might think you need. Instead, you start the revolution small by initiating whatever it is you want to do. You don't try, you just do. You don't ask for permission, you just start.

Leadership is the process of reaching a goal by influencing. You can only influence others by doing. You can always apologize later.
